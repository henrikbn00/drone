        <h1>Repair Station</h1>
        <p>The emergency station also include a repair station where people can come
        and deliver drones for the trained and professional staff to repair.
        People that have a drone that needs fixing or some form of maintenance can deliver their drone and get it fixed.
        </p>
        <p>The repair station is in the same building where the teams operate in an eventual emergency
        calling, and if there is an emergency they get into action in no time. The repair shop
        gives the facility money to use on the drones for maintenance and other investment. The priority
        is always the emergency department and all customers will know that if an emergency happens, the staff
        must prioritize the emergency call. </p>
