        <h1>Repair Station</h1>
        <p>The emergency drones idea also include a repair station where people can come
        and deliver drones for the trained and professional staff to repair.
        THe repair station is in the same building where the teams operate in an eventual emergency
        calling and if there is an emmergency they get into action in no time. The repairs shop
        gives the facility money to use on the drones for maintence and other investment. The priority
        is always the emergency department and all customers knows that if an emergency happens, the staff
        must prioritize the emergency call. </p>
